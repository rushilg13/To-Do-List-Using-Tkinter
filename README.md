# To-Do-List-Using-Tkinter
This is a To do list using Tkinter. Sqlite3 has been used as database and foe each update on the database, the date and time of saving is also saved in the database. Checkboxes have been provided to mark the completion of tasks. New lists can be added, Existing ones can be exited and saved to the database. I have tried to implement a dark theme to the application.
